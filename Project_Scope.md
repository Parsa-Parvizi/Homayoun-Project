#### 1\. Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive system to manage the production, sales, purchases, and shipments of recycled packaging paper. The system will facilitate real-time and historical data tracking, providing insights into inventory levels, order management, and logistics operations.

#### 2\. Objectives

-   To automate the tracking of incoming and outgoing shipments, including weight measurements and truck management.
-   To manage the database of trucks, suppliers, and customers efficiently.
-   To facilitate the creation and management of purchase and sales orders.
-   To maintain an up-to-date inventory of raw materials and finished products.
-   To generate detailed reports on sales, purchases, and inventory consumption.

#### 3\. Features and Functionalities

##### 3.1 Truck Management

-   Add and manage truck information, including license numbers, driver details, and status.
-   Track truck movements and statuses (e.g., free, busy, loading, unloading).

##### 3.2 Shipment Management

-   Process incoming shipments, including weight verification, unloading, and inventory updates.
-   Handle outgoing shipments, including loading, weight verification, and order fulfillment.

##### 3.3 Order Management

-   Create, update, and manage purchase orders based on supplier shipments.
-   Generate sales orders, calculate total prices including VAT, and manage customer deliveries.

##### 3.4 Inventory Management

-   Maintain records of in-stock raw materials and finished product reels.
-   Track consumption of raw materials and update inventory in real-time.

##### 3.5 Reporting
