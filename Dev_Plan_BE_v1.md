### Backend Development Breakdown for the Project

#### Major Task: Setting up Django with PostgreSQL

-   Sub-task 1: Install Django and PostgreSQL: Install Django within a virtual environment and PostgreSQL on your development machine. Ensure Python and pip are up to date for Django installation.
-   Sub-task 2: Configure Django for PostgreSQL: Modify the `DATABASES` setting in Django's `settings.py` to use PostgreSQL, including database name, user, and password.
-   Sub-task 3: Create Django Models: Define models in Django that correspond to the database schema, including fields and relationships between tables.
-   Sub-task 4: Run Migrations: Generate and apply migrations to create the database schema in PostgreSQL based on the models defined.
-   Sub-task 5: Admin Interface Setup: Set up the Django admin interface to manage database records for ease of administration and testing.

#### Major Task: RESTful API Development

-   Sub-task 1: Install Django Rest Framework (DRF): Add DRF to the project to facilitate API development.
-   Sub-task 2: Serializer Creation: Create serializers for converting between model instances and JSON format for API responses.
-   Sub-task 3: API Viewsets: Implement viewsets for handling CRUD operations on the models via HTTP methods.
-   Sub-task 4: Routing: Configure URL routes to map HTTP requests to the appropriate viewsets.
-   Sub-task 5: Authentication and Permissions: Implement authentication and permission classes in DRF to secure the API.

#### Major Task: Business Logic Implementation

-   Sub-task 1: Input Validation: Implement input validation in both serializers and views to ensure data integrity.
-   Sub-task 2: Process Implementation: Encode business processes (e.g., shipment creation, updates) within Django views or service classes.
-   Sub-task 3: Error Handling: Develop robust error handling to manage and log exceptions, ensuring API stability.
-   Sub-task 4: Unit Testing: Write unit tests for models, API endpoints, and business logic to ensure reliability.
-   Sub-task 5: Integration with Frontend: Ensure the API integrates smoothly with the Vue.js frontend, including CORS setup for AJAX requests.

#### Major Task: Data Reporting and Exports

-   Sub-task 1: Reporting Views: Create custom views in Django to generate reports (e.g., sales, purchases) based on database records.
-   Sub-task 2: Data Aggregation: Implement methods for aggregating data (sums, averages, counts) across models for reporting purposes.
-   Sub-task 3: Export to CSV/Excel: Develop functionality to export reports to CSV or Excel formats for offline analysis.
-   Sub-task 4: Scheduled Reporting: Set up periodic tasks (using Celery or Django-crontab) for generating and emailing reports at regular intervals.
-   Sub-task 5: Real-time Data Feeds: Implement WebSocket or long-polling endpoints for real-time data feeds to the frontend.

#### Major Task: Security and Optimization

-   Sub-task 1: Secure API Access: Implement token-based authentication or OAuth for API security.
-   Sub-task 2: Database Optimization: Analyze queries and use indexes, viewsets, and query optimization techniques to improve performance.
-   Sub-task 3: Data Encryption: Implement encryption for sensitive data stored in the database or transmitted via the API.
-   Sub-task 4: Rate Limiting: Introduce API rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure service availability.
-   Sub-task 5: Logging and Monitoring: Set up logging for tracking errors and performance metrics, and use tools like Sentry for real-time monitoring.
