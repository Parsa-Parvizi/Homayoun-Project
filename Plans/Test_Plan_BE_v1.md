For Phase 3: Core Backend Development, breaking down the tasks into detailed components will help ensure comprehensive coverage of all necessary aspects. Here are 20 major tasks to cover all crucial elements:

### 1\. Define Core Functionalities

-   1.1 Identify all required backend functionalities from the project requirements.
-   1.2 Create a list of API endpoints needed for each functionality.
-   1.3 Prioritize functionalities based on dependencies and project milestones.

### 2\. Setup Development Environment

-   2.1 Ensure all developers have the correct version of Python, Django, and other dependencies installed.
-   2.2 Establish a local development database that mirrors the production setup.
-   2.3 Configure virtual environments for isolated development.

### 3\. Develop Business Logic

-   3.1 Implement the logic for managing shipments, including CRUD operations.
-   3.2 Code the business logic for inventory management, considering stock levels, reordering, etc.
-   3.3 Develop the logic for sales order processing, including validations and calculations.
-   3.4 Create functionalities for purchase order management.

### 4\. Implement Data Models and Relationships

-   4.1 Refine Django models based on finalized database schema.
-   4.2 Establish model relationships (ForeignKey, ManyToMany, OneToOne) as per the requirements.
-   4.3 Implement model methods for common queries and operations.

### 5\. Setup Backend APIs

-   5.1 Design RESTful API structure for efficient data exchange.
-   5.2 Implement API views for handling requests and responses.
-   5.3 Use Django Rest Framework (DRF) serializers for object serialization and validation.

### 6\. Authentication and Authorization

-   6.1 Set up user authentication using Django's built-in system or DRF.
-   6.2 Implement token-based authentication for API access.
-   6.3 Define permission classes and roles for different user types.

### 7\. Testing and QA

-   7.1 Write unit tests for model methods and business logic.
-   7.2 Implement integration tests for API endpoints.
-   7.3 Conduct stress tests on critical functionalities to ensure stability.

### 8\. Error Handling and Logging

-   8.1 Develop a comprehensive error handling strategy for the backend.
-   8.2 Implement logging for critical processes and error tracking.
-   8.3 Create custom exception classes for specific error scenarios.

### 9\. API Documentation

-   9.1 Document all API endpoints using tools like Swagger or DRF's documentation features.
-   9.2 Include examples of request and response bodies.

### 10\. Performance Optimization

-   10.1 Optimize database queries using Django's ORM capabilities.
-   10.2 Implement caching where necessary to reduce load times.
-   10.3 Analyze and reduce API response times.

### 11\. Security Measures

-   11.1 Conduct a security audit of API endpoints.
-   11.2 Implement measures to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
-   11.3 Secure sensitive data with encryption at rest and in transit.

### 12\. Background Tasks

-   12.1 Set up Celery with Django for handling long-running or scheduled tasks.
-   12.2 Implement tasks for operations like sending batch emails or processing large data.

### 13\. Integrations

-   13.1 Integrate any required third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, email services).
-   13.2 Ensure secure and efficient communication with external APIs.

### 14\. Continuous Integration and Deployment

-   14.1 Refine GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing.
-   14.2 Set up staging and production environments for continuous deployment.
-   14.3 Implement database migration strategies for deployment.

### 15\. Monitoring and Alerts

-   15.1 Set up application monitoring using tools like Sentry or New Relic.
-   15.2 Configure alerts for system errors and performance bottlenecks.

### 16\. Refactoring and Code Review

-   16.1 Regularly refactor code for readability and maintainability.
-   16.2 Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards.

### 17\. User Feedback Loop
