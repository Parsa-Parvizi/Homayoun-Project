        -   Install Vue CLI and create a new Vue.js project.
        -   Configure Vue Router for handling page navigation.
        -   Set up Vuex for state management across components.
        -   Integrate Axios for API requests to the Django backend.
        -   Ensure responsive design using Vuetify or Bootstrap Vue.
2.  Component Design and Development

    -   Sub-tasks:
        -   Design reusable components (e.g., input forms, buttons, tables).
        -   Implement forms for data entry (shipments, suppliers, etc.) with validation.
        -   Create dynamic tables for displaying data with options to filter, sort, and paginate.
        -   Develop modals for confirmations and detailed views.
        -   Implement custom directives or filters for common tasks, like formatting dates or numbers.
3.  State Management with Vuex

    -   Sub-tasks:
        -   Define Vuex store structure (modules for shipments, authentication, etc.).
        -   Implement actions to fetch data from the backend and mutations to update the state.
        -   Use getters for accessing state properties efficiently.
        -   Handle authentication state and user permissions.
        -   Persist certain state parts (e.g., user session) across page reloads using local storage or cookies.
4.  API Integration and Data Handling

    -   Sub-tasks:
        -   Develop services using Axios to handle API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
        -   Implement error handling for API responses and display user-friendly messages.
        -   Use Vuex actions to integrate API calls and update the state based on responses.
        -   Implement loading states and indicators for asynchronous operations.
        -   Ensure data consistency and handle pagination, sorting, and filtering on the client side.
5.  Routing and Navigation

    -   Sub-tasks:
        -   Configure Vue Router with routes for different parts of the application.
        -   Implement route guards for authentication and authorization checks.
        -   Use dynamic routing for detail views (e.g., shipment details).
        -   Optimize navigation with lazy loading for routes.
        -   Create a navigation bar or sidebar for accessing main application areas.
