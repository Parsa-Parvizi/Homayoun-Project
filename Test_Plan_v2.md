#### Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning (Day 1)

-   Activities:
    -   Set up the development environment with necessary tools and frameworks.
    -   Initialize the Django project and configure the LAMP server on RPI4.
    -   Create a GitHub repository for version control and set up a Kanban board for project management.
    -   Configure GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI) to automate testing for each pull request.
-   Deliverables:
    -   Development environment, project skeleton on GitHub.
    -   CI/CD pipeline initial setup.
-   Testing/QA:
    -   Ensure the development environment is correctly set up.

#### Phase 2: Database Design and Models (Day 4)

-   Incremental Development:
    -   Break down the database design and model implementation into small, manageable tasks (stories) on the Kanban board.
-   Activities:
    -   Design the database schema and implement Django models incrementally, focusing on entities like shipments, trucks, customers, suppliers, etc.
-   Continuous Deployment:
    -   Set up automatic deployment to a staging environment on successful CI builds for immediate feedback.
-   Testing/QA:
    -   Automated tests for model integrity and relations.

#### Phase 3: Core Backend Development (Days 10)

-   Incremental Development:
    -   Use Kanban to manage and prioritize development tasks for business logic related to shipments, inventory management, etc.
-   Continuous Deployment:
    -   Refine CI/CD pipelines to deploy backend changes to the staging environment, enabling quick feedback loops.
-   Testing/QA:
    -   Unit and integration testing for backend logic and APIs.

#### Phase 4: Frontend Development and Integration (Days 10)

-   Incremental Development:
    -   Develop frontend components and features in iterations, moving tasks from "To Do" to "Done" on the Kanban board.
-   Continuous Deployment:
    -   Extend CI/CD pipelines to include frontend builds, ensuring that the integrated system is deployed to the staging environment for testing.
-   Testing/QA:
    -   UI/UX testing across devices, functional testing of the integrated system.

#### Phase 5: Advanced Features and Additional Integrations (Days 3)

-   Incremental Development:
    -   Introduce advanced features and integrations as new tasks on the Kanban, prioritizing based on feedback and requirements.
-   Continuous Deployment:
    -   Ensure that new features and third-party integrations are automatically deployed to the staging environment for immediate review.
-   Testing/QA:
    -   Test advanced features and third-party integrations for functionality and performance.

#### Phase 6: Deployment Preparation and Initial Testing (Days 2)

-   Activities:
    -   Prepare the deployment environment on RPI4, including final CI/CD configurations for production.
-   Continuous Deployment:
    -   Implement blue-green or canary deployments to minimize downtime and risks associated with the production release.
-   Testing/QA:
    -   Conduct smoke testing and performance benchmarking in the production environment.

#### Phase 7: Documentation, Training, and Final QA (Days 2)

-   Incremental Development:
    -   Document features and updates as they are developed. Use Kanban to track documentation tasks.
-   Testing/QA:
    -   Final QA testing, including security and user acceptance testing with real-world scenarios.

#### Phase 8: Project Review and Closure (Days 2)

-   Activities:
    -   Use Kanban to review completed tasks and backlog items, ensuring all objectives are met and documenting lessons learned.
-   Testing/QA:
    -   Validate final adjustments, ensuring the system is ready for long-term operation.
