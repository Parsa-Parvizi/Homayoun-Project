Before I address your request for detailing the major tasks for the testing phase of Phase 3 and providing sub-tasks with explanations, I'll review the uploaded document "Documentation_ISMv900R2015.pdf" to ensure my recommendations are aligned with your project's specific requirements and context.

Let's first carefully review the document.

Given the detailed overview from the document, I'll outline the major tasks for the testing phase of Phase 3 (Core Backend Development), focusing on the system's ability to handle shipments, inventory management, and data integrity, as per the project's outlined requirements.

### Phase 3: Core Backend Development Testing

#### Task 1: Unit Testing for Models

-   1.1 Test Model Validations: Ensure all model fields validate data as expected (e.g., string lengths, numerical ranges).
-   1.2 Test Model Methods: Validate custom methods in models perform correctly under various conditions.
-   1.3 Test Data Integrity: Ensure integrity constraints (e.g., unique constraints, foreign keys) are enforced.
-   1.4 Test Default Values: Verify default values are correctly applied to model fields.
-   1.5 Test Relationship Behaviors: Ensure model relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) function as expected, including cascading deletes or updates.

#### Task 2: API Endpoint Testing

-   2.1 Test CRUD Operations: Verify that Create, Read, Update, Delete operations work for all endpoints.
-   2.2 Test Response Formats: Ensure responses are correctly structured and return appropriate status codes.
-   2.3 Test Authentication and Authorization: Verify endpoints enforce authentication and permissions correctly.
-   2.4 Test Filtering and Pagination: Ensure APIs support filtering and pagination parameters as expected.
-   2.5 Test Error Handling: Test APIs for correct error responses on bad requests or server errors.

#### Task 3: Integration Testing for Business Processes

-   3.1 Test Shipment Process: Simulate the full shipment process, from creation to completion, and ensure data consistency across related entities.
-   3.2 Test Inventory Management: Verify that inventory updates reflect accurately in the database after transactions.
-   3.3 Test Purchase Order Creation: Ensure purchase orders are generated correctly based on shipment data and inventory status.
-   3.4 Test Sales Order Processing: Simulate sales order processing and validate updates to inventory and financial records.
-   3.5 Test Backup and Recovery: Verify that database backups occur as scheduled and can be restored accurately.

#### Task 4: Performance Testing

-   4.1 Load Testing: Simulate high traffic to test system performance and scalability.
-   4.2 Stress Testing: Determine the system's failover points under extreme load conditions.
-   4.3 Concurrency Testing: Test the system's behavior under concurrent user actions to ensure data consistency.
-   4.4 Transaction Speed: Measure the response times for database transactions under normal and peak loads.
-   4.5 Profile System Resources: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage during test scenarios to identify potential bottlenecks.

#### Task 5: Security Testing

-   5.1 SQL Injection: Test for vulnerabilities to SQL injection attacks across all input fields.
-   5.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Check for XSS vulnerabilities in user input fields and API endpoints.
-   5.3 Authentication Bypass: Attempt to access protected resources without proper authentication to test security measures.
-   5.4 Data Encryption: Verify that sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
-   5.5 Access Control: Test for proper implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access appropriate resources.

#### Task 6: Regression Testing

-   6.1 Automated Regression Suite: Run a comprehensive suite of automated tests to ensure new code changes have not introduced regressions.
-   6.2 Edge Case Testing: Test system behavior with edge case data and scenarios to ensure stability.
-   6.3 Dependency Testing: Verify that updates to external dependencies do not break application functionality.
-   6.4 Cross-Version Compatibility: Ensure the system functions correctly across different versions of browsers and dependencies.
-   6.5 Rollback Testing: Test the ability to rollback deployments in case of critical failures after updates.

#### Task 7: Usability Testing

-   7.1 Form Input Validation: Ensure user inputs are validated on both client and server sides for all forms.
-   7.2 Workflow Navigation: Test the logical flow of core business processes through the UI to ensure intuitiveness.
-   7.3 Mobile Responsiveness: Verify that the application is fully functional and user-friendly on mobile devices.
-   7.4 Error Messaging: Check that error messages are informative and guide the user towards resolving input errors.
-   7.5 Accessibility Compliance: Test compliance with web accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to ensure the application is accessible to all users.

#### Task 8: Compatibility Testing

-   8.1 Browser Compatibility: Test the application on various browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure consistent behavior.
-   8.2 Device Compatibility: Ensure the application functions correctly across different devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
-   8.3 Operating System Compatibility: Test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to identify OS-specific issues.
-   8.4 Screen Resolution Testing: Verify that the application layout adjusts correctly for various screen resolutions and aspect ratios.
-   8.5 Internationalization and Localization: Test the application's ability to handle different languages and regional settings if applicable.

#### Task 9: Environmental Testing

-   9.1 Test on Development Environment: Validate that all functionalities work as expected in the development setup.
-   9.2 Test on Staging Environment: Ensure the application behaves correctly in an environment that mirrors production.
-   9.3 Network Conditions Testing: Test application performance under various network speeds and conditions.
-   9.4 Power Failure and Recovery: Simulate power failures to test system recovery and data integrity.
-   9.5 Hardware Failure Simulation: Test the application's resilience and failover mechanisms in case of hardware malfunctions.

#### Task 10: Documentation and Reporting

-   10.1 Test Case Documentation: Document all test cases, including purpose, steps, expected results, and actual results.
-   10.2 Bug Reporting: Report bugs with detailed steps to reproduce, expected outcomes, actual outcomes, and severity levels.
-   10.3 Test Coverage Report: Generate reports detailing the extent of code and feature coverage by the tests.
-   10.4 Performance Benchmark Report: Compile performance benchmarks, highlighting response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
-   10.5 Security Audit Report: Present findings from security testing, including vulnerabilities, risks, and recommendations for mitigation.
